# Notes
Dec. 16, 2021 - After a long break, I have come back to continue the fullstack open.

Using `git subtree push --prefix part3 heroku main` to deploy

## Exercise 3.10
The deployed backend can be found here: https://murmuring-journey-70901.herokuapp.com/

See the `heroku` branch for the files that were sent over, the `main` branch may not reflect the status of the app.

## Exercise 3.11
The `main` branch now contains the current app (see link above).

Added the frontend files for building.
