# Notes
This branch contains the submissions for part 3c - Saving data to MongoDB

## Exercise 3.19
Nothing special in particular, used `mongoose-unique-validator`; commented out the old code.

## Exercise 3.20
Updated the old `update` error handler to no longer remove the updated item since that error is irrelevant now. The handler now just prints the error. The handler for `create` does the same thing. 

## Exercise 3.21
No code changes made for deployment.

## Exercise 3.22
